npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated phin@2.9.3: Package no longer supported. Contact Support at https://www.npmjs.com/support for more info.
npm warn deprecated npmlog@5.0.1: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated @esbuild-kit/esm-loader@2.6.5: Merged into tsx: https://tsx.is
npm warn deprecated stable@0.1.8: Modern JS already guarantees Array#sort() is a stable sort, so this library is deprecated. See the compatibility table on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#browser_compatibility
npm warn deprecated source-map-url@0.4.1: See https://github.com/lydell/source-map-url#deprecated
npm warn deprecated request-promise-native@1.0.9: request-promise-native has been deprecated because it extends the now deprecated request package, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm warn deprecated @esbuild-kit/core-utils@3.3.2: Merged into tsx: https://tsx.is
npm warn deprecated urix@0.1.0: Please see https://github.com/lydell/urix#deprecated
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated abab@2.0.6: Use your platform's native atob() and btoa() methods instead
npm warn deprecated q@1.5.1: You or someone you depend on is using Q, the JavaScript Promise library that gave JavaScript developers strong feelings about promises. They can almost certainly migrate to the native JavaScript promise now. Thank you literally everyone for joining me in this bet against the odds. Be excellent to each other.
npm warn deprecated
npm warn deprecated (For a CapTP with native promises, see @endo/eventual-send and @endo/captp)
npm warn deprecated domexception@1.0.1: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
npm warn deprecated acorn-dynamic-import@2.0.2: This is probably built in to whatever tool you're using. If you still need it... idk
npm warn deprecated are-we-there-yet@2.0.0: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated source-map-resolve@0.5.3: See https://github.com/lydell/source-map-resolve#deprecated
npm warn deprecated resolve-url@0.2.1: https://github.com/lydell/resolve-url#deprecated
npm warn deprecated w3c-hr-time@1.0.2: Use your platform's native performance.now() and performance.timeOrigin.
npm warn deprecated gauge@3.0.2: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated uuid@3.4.0: Please upgrade  to version 7 or higher.  Older versions may use Math.random() in certain circumstances, which is known to be problematic.  See https://v8.dev/blog/math-random for details.
npm warn deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
npm warn deprecated mkdirp@0.5.1: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
npm warn deprecated core-js@2.6.12: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.
