# ILMBUDS - Islamic Children's Educational App

## Overview

ILMBUDS is a comprehensive Islamic educational mobile application designed for children, featuring interactive quizzes, stories, Quran learning, religious teachings (Ilmihal), and cartoons. The app is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Capacitor for native mobile deployment, supporting multiple languages (English, Albanian, Bosnian, German, Italian) and featuring AdMob integration for monetization.

### Database Management
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema changes
- **Command**: `npm run db:push` for schema updates
- **Environment**: Production database via `DATABASE_URL`

### Development Workflow
- **Dev Server**: `npm run dev` - TSX with hot reload
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` - TypeScript validation
- **Build**: `npm run build` - Production build
- **Start**: `npm run start` - Production server

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared schema and translations, making it easy to maintain consistency across client and server components while supporting multiple languages and platforms.
