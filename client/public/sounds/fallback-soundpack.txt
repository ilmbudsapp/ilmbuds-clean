Due to the unreliable nature of external sound URLs, we're providing fallback sounds hosted locally.

The Islamic phrases have been replaced with locally hosted audio files that will work reliably across all devices and network conditions.

This approach ensures that the application will continue to function correctly even when external resources are unavailable.
